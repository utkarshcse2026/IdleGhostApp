# 👻 IdleGhost — The Ultimate Anti-Idle Mouse & Keyboard Automator

## 👑 Creator

**IdleGhost** was created and maintained by [Utkarsh Aggarwal](https://github.com/utkarshcse2026).  
Made with sarcasm, caffeine, and zero warranty.


**IdleGhost** is a stealthy and smart desktop application that simulates human-like mouse movements, keystrokes, and scrolling to prevent you from being marked as “idle” by time tracking software like **Hubstaff**, **Time Doctor**, or **Teramind**.
