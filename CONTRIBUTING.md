# 👻 IdleGhost Contributor Manifesto

Welcome to the **IdleGhost** project — where stealth meets automation.

We're building a playful, powerful, and **educational tool** designed to explore idle-time simulation, automation, and activity spoofing — purely for personal productivity and curiosity-driven development. IdleGhost is open source, and this community is yours to shape. But first, a few ground rules to keep the ghostly codebase clean and collaborative.

---

## 🚀 What We’re Building

IdleGhost isn't just a script — it’s a movement.

A movement for developers, tinkerers, and thinkers who want to:

* Understand how time trackers detect activity
* Explore ethical automation
* Learn GUI simulation and background scripting
* Build tools that help users stay active (even when AFK 😉)

This tool is designed for **educational use**, creative experimentation, and harmless productivity hacking — **not** for deception or abuse.

## 🧑‍💻 Contribution Guidelines

To maintain the integrity of the project, please follow these rules:

### ✅ Do:

* **Fork** the repository before making any changes
* **Create your own branch**, named after your GitHub username or feature:
* git checkout -b feature/yourname
* * **Code responsibly and cleanly**: Comment your logic, format your files, and test your changes
* **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** with a clear description of what you're adding or fixing
* **Open issues** to suggest features or report bugs
* **Respect others' contributions**

### 🚫 Don’t:

* Push directly to the `main` branch
* Delete or overwrite others’ work
* Introduce bloat, malicious behavior, or misleading claims

---

## 🧠 Community Philosophy

We're here to build, learn, and share. This is a judgment-free zone for:

* First-time contributors
* Curious developers who want to reverse-engineer idle tracking
* Anyone who wants to make tech just a little more fun and open

Let’s maintain a culture of mentorship, technical quality, and ghostly good vibes 👻

---

## 🎁 Contributor Recognition & Rewards

To encourage great work:

* The **top contributors** will be featured on the [official website](https://idleghost.vercel.app/) (coming soon)
* Noteworthy features and bug fixes will be **highlighted in release notes**
* We may introduce **bounties** or sponsor shoutouts for major contributions
* Every commit that makes IdleGhost smarter or stealthier gets you a little closer to immortality in our Contributors Hall 🔥

---

## 🛠 Suggestions for Contribution

Here are ideas if you're looking for where to start:

* Add **tray minimization** or **hotkey toggles**
* Improve **GUI theming** or animations
* Build **macOS/Linux support** modules
* Add a **stealth mode** or process-hiding workaround
* Refactor into modules or support **plugin architecture**

You can also contribute by improving the docs, writing setup tutorials, or making memes. Yes, memes are real contributions 😎

## 🔒 Licensing & Ethics

This project is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE), which allows broad use and modification — but you must retain attribution.

> Use responsibly.  
> Don’t deploy this in ways that violate company policies, agreements, or platform rules.  
> Be smart. Be ethical. Be ghostly. 👻

## 📣 Final Words from the Creator

Hey devs,

I created IdleGhost to explore system automation and teach others how things like input tracking work under the hood. This project is for learning, not cheating.

So here’s my ask:

* **Don’t modify `main`** — create your branch, go wild, and open a PR
* **Let’s grow this together** as a proper open source project
* **Follow me on GitHub** if you vibe with this vision — more open tools are on the way

Together, we’ll build the most lovable little ghost the system never saw coming 💻🦶💨

**CLONE — CODE — CREATE — CONTRIBUTE**  
Let’s haunt some time trackers and learn while doing it.

# 👾 Additional Contribution Notes (aka Sarcastic Survival Guide)

Welcome to IdleGhost – the productivity app for your keyboard’s ghost.  
This isn’t your grandma’s idle script. We have standards. And sass.

## 🧠 What We Expect

- **Stealth is non-negotiable** – no random popups, no noisy windows, no taskbar betrayal.
- **Sarcasm is sacred** – if you're not coding with a smirk, you're probably doing it wrong.
- **Code should work** – yes, even ghostly simulations need structure.

## 💻 How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repo  
2. **Clone** your fork locally  
3. Create a **new branch** for your feature/fix  
4. Make changes (quietly and cleverly)  
5. Commit with sarcastic flair  
6. Push and open a **PR** (Pull Request)

## 🛠️ Development Ground Rules

- Use **Python 3.8+**
- Stick to **Tkinter** and light dependencies
- Make logs **funny, local, and safe**
- Maintain **stealth and minimalism**

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `main.py` – ghost HQ
- `assets/` – icons, easter eggs, etc.
- `activity_logs/` – fake work archive vault

## ⚖️ Legal Witchcraft

MIT License. No lawsuits. Just give credit.
